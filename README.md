There is also a simulation of the device running at:

I will be uploading the CAD files shortly but I still have a little work to do to get it into shape.
This is a development of my earlier Switched Flux Transmission devices (see my SFT-* repos) but whilst they were designed to take input energy and (possibly) amplify it using flux switching, this version may require no input energy, operating because of the flux switches automatically due to the device geometry.

There is a description of how the device is supposed to work on my website: https://tomboy-pink.co.uk/sfmm

Here's a labelled image of the parts:
